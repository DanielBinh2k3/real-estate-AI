# **App Name**: EstateValuate

## Core Features:

- Property Input: Input property details: Allow users to enter key information about the property, such as address, size, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and lot size.
- AI Valuation Tool: AI-powered valuation: Utilize a tool that uses provided property details combined with current market data to estimate the property's value.
- Value Display: Display estimated value: Clearly present the AI's estimated property value to the user.
- Comparable Sales: Comparable properties: Display recent sales of similar properties in the area.
- Interactive Map: Map View: Show the location of the property and comparable sales on an interactive map.
- Core Valuation: This is the central feature. The application provides an estimated value range for the property, including: Low value: The minimum possible price on the market. Reasonable value: The most likely price, highlighted (15.6 billion in the picture). High value: The maximum achievable price. Purpose: To give users a clear price reference framework instead of just a single number, accurately reflecting market fluctuations.
- Market Comparison: Horizontal bar chart comparing Your Value (estimated fair value) to the general Market Range. Purpose: Helps users know where their property value falls within the price spectrum of similar properties on the market (high, medium, or low).
- Price Trend Analysis: Line graph showing the change in price/mÂ² in the vicinity over the months. Purpose: Provides extremely valuable information about market trends. Users can know whether prices in this area are increasing, decreasing, or stable, thereby making better buying/selling decisions.
- Multi-criteria Scoring: Radar chart (spider web) scoring assets based on 5 important criteria: Location: Prime location, traffic. Utilities: Surrounding utilities (schools, markets, hospitals). Planning: Regional planning situation. Legal: Status of books and documents. Quality: Construction quality, house condition. Purpose: Helps users quickly see the strengths and weaknesses of a property intuitively. For example, a property may have a very good Location but poor Quality.
- Detailed Information: Information blocks provide detailed interpretations of the points on the radar chart, including specific nearby amenities (markets, schools, hospitals) and legal status (e.g., Red Book). Purpose: Provide evidence and specific data to support the scores given.
- Map Visualization: A map showing the exact location of the property along with the boundaries of the area (ward/commune). Purpose: Visualize the location, helping users easily visualize the context surrounding the property. This feature could very well use data from the geographic APIs we worked with earlier.
- Comparable Properties: A list of other properties with similar characteristics being offered for sale in the area, with photos, prices and areas. Purpose: Provide real market comps. Users can compare directly with other properties to verify the application's estimated price.
